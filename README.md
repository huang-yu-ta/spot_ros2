# Spot ROS2 Driver
This is a ROS 2 implemantion of the [ROS1 driver](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/spot_ros) from Clearpath.
All ROS services are ported, but only the services: claim, power_on, stand and sit were tested.
The `/cmd_vel` topic also works and you can send commands to the spot via e.g. rqt_publisher.
This project is still WIP.

## Issues
1. ROS2 Action: "NavTo" has not test yet.
2. Arm control still got some errors.
3. cmd_vel working weird sometimes.

## Prerequisites
    - Tested for ubuntu 20.04
    - ROS 2 foxy

## Install
    pip3 install bosdyn-client bosdyn-mission bosdyn-api bosdyn-core
    sudo apt install ros-foxy-joint-state-publisher-gui
    cd path/to/ros2/ws
    git clone https://github.com/MASKOR/Spot-ROS2.git src/
    colcon build --symlink-install

### Install depth image proc
Since `DepthCloud` is not yet ported for rviz2 , we can use [depth_image_proc](http://wiki.ros.org/depth_image_proc) to visualize the depth information from the cameras as `Pointcloud2`.

    sudo apt install ros-foxy-depth-image-proc

## Launch
The spot login data hostname, username and password must be specified in the `config/spot_login.yaml` of the spot_driver package.

### Model
    ros2 launch spot_description description.launch.py

### SpotDriver
    ros2 launch spot_driver spot_driver.launch.py

### Depth image to Pointcloud2
    ros2 launch spot_driver point_cloud_xyz.launch.py
